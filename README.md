# Final-Journal

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I take the information given from the user which is then given to the product owner. The product owner should then look at these stories and give them to the team. From there the team is able to create a backlog to try to get all of the user stories in place from most important to least to have a deliverable prodcut. The Scrum Master is able to be the liason/servant leader/ and remover of impediments for the developers. User stories help because we are getting exactly what the final product needs and helps the developers figure out what is needed from them to complete the project.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I will approach the Agile frame work using SAFe in future development work. I will make sure to have open ended communication and to also encourage inovation with the team. I will make sure to also be timley, conduct daily stand ups, and to make sure I assist the team with all needs of impediments being removed.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means that you are responsible for not only your own work but to also make sure you are helping out wherever is needed. It makes sure that you lift up the team as well as making sure your work is done to the fullest extent. When you have time you should offer a helping hand to make sure that you are doing everythig you can to assist the team.
